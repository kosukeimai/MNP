Description: Fits the Bayesian multinomial probit model via Markov chain 
        Monte Carlo.  The multinomial probit model is often used to analyze 
        the discrete choices made by individuals recorded in survey data.
        Examples where the multinomial probit model may be useful
        include the analysis of product choice by consumers in market
        research and the analysis of candidate or party choice by
        voters in electoral studies.  The MNP software can also fit the
        model with different choice sets for each individual, and
        complete or partial individual choice orderings of the
        available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation is
        based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm
        that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005). ``A Bayesian
        Analysis of the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data
        Augmentation,'' Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 124, No. 2
        (February), pp. 311-334. <DOI:10.1016/j.jeconom.2004.02.002>
        Detailed examples are given in Imai and van Dyk (2005).
